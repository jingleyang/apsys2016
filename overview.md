# Overview
Building on the success of its 2010-2015
predecessors in
[New Delhi, India](http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2010/APSys.php);
[Shanghai, China](http://apsys11.ucsd.edu/);
[Seoul, South Korea](http://apsys2012.kaist.ac.kr/);
[Singapore](http://apsys13.sutd.edu.sg/);
[Beijing, China](http://acs.ict.ac.cn/apsys2014/) and [Tokyo, Japan](http://www.sslab.ics.keio.ac.jp/apsys2015/).
APSys 2016 will continue to be a lively
forum for systems researchers and practitioners across the world to meet, interact, and
collaborate with their peers from the Asia/Pacific region. The 2016 ACM APsys will be held in [Hong
Kong, China](http://www.cs.hku.hk/apsys2016/) from August 4-5, 2016.
We take a broad view of computer systems, and solicit papers on topics such as:

* Operating systems, their interaction with hardware architecture and programming languages, and vice versa
* Virtualization, including its novel applications
* File and storage systems
* Network systems including both wired and wireless networks
* Mobile, embedded and pervasive systems
* Cloud computing and data center management
* Systems for Big Data Analytics 
* Distributed systems
* Internet of Things
* System energy characterization and optimization 
* Testing and verification of computer systems
* Measurement, monitoring, and modeling
* Reliability, scalability, and fault tolerance
* Security and privacy
* Experience with deployed systems
* Application of interesting research ideas to computer systems, such as machine learning, stochastic modeling, new algorithms.
